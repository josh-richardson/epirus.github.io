Clicking on the relevent menu item will take you to the associated page. Dashboard \u00b6 The Epirus dashboard provides a summary of key metrics of the blockchain contracts, including: Total transctions, token contracts and peers Graphical transaction count broken down by transaction type (contract creation, contract transaction, currency transfer) Most active contracts Fungible (ERC20) versus non-fungible token contracts (ERC721) Tokens \u00b6 The tokens view provides a view of all tokens deployed in the network, with separate labels for fungible or non-fungible tokens following the ERC20 and ERC721 Ethereum standards respectively. If we click on one of our tokens, we get more information about it (as in the Contracts view). Here you can see the attributes of the token. You can also see details of the transfer events that have taken place for that token. Contracts \u00b6 The contracts view displays all contracts that have been deployed to your network. Here you can see details of all contracts deployed to the network. Those contracts that comply with well defined interfaces are automatically tagged with a type in the Label column to reflect this. For example, ERC20 for fungible token contracts, ERC721 for non-fungible token contracts, and Custom for those that have not been registered in the contract registry. The Name column provides the contract name if the contract is registered in the Epirus contract registry. To learn more about the contract registry, head here . When you click on a contract, you are taken into the contract details page which has various information about the contract. Here you can see details of all transactions associated with the contract and events emmitted by these transactions. If the contract is registered in the registry, events and their parameter names and values will be decoded. Private transactions are labelled with a Private label. They will only be decipherable if the node that the Epirus instance is connected to is privy to the transaction. Transactions \u00b6 The Transactions view provides the details of individual transactions, including private transactions when supported by your blockchain. When you vieiw a transaction details you will be able to view lower-level details, such as the input byte code, which is available under the Additional Details menu. Blocks \u00b6 The blocks view provides details of all blocks being generated on the network. As with the transactions view, technical details are available here too under the Additional Details menu. Here you can see detailsi such as the block difficulty and gas consumed. Accounts \u00b6 Clicking on an address that is not associated with a smart contract, i.e. it holds Ether, will bring up the account view, which displays the current balance and transactions associated with the account. Search \u00b6 The search box in the top-right corner of the screen allows you to search by various criteria, including: Contract address Account address Transaction hash Block hash If a match is found the associated contract, account, transaction or block details will be displayed. Advanced sorting and filters \u00b6 Another key feature is the addition of sorting and filters in Epirus. This enables our users to find very active contracts by sorting their various views by key attributes. Contracts can be sorted by transaction date, transaction count or event contracts by transaction count. The filters provided also allow you to view subsets of the available data, such as only displaying contract creation transactions or fungible tokens in the Tokens view. Peers \u00b6 The peers view provides insights into the peers that your node is connected to.

This documentation reflects the features of our AWS, Azure and Enterprise versions. Azure \u00b6 The Azure Marketplace offer is the simplest full version of Epirus to get up and running with. It requires an active Azure cloud subscription You will need to provide details of your managed ledger (or Ethereum/Quorum/Hyperledger Besu) node. In your Azure portal, navigate to the Azure Blockchain Service instance you wish to use. From here click Transaction nodes -> <your-transaction-node> -> Connection strings Then copy the HTTPS access keys with node URL, such as https://<your-service>.blockchain.azure.com:3200/<acess-key> You will be able to access the Explorer UI via http://<instance-name>-<uuid>.<region>.cloudapp.azure.com To view the actual URL, navigate to the Overview page for the resource group you used for Epirus, then head to Deployments -> blk-technologies.... -> Outputs -> epirusUrl . Please allow a few minutes for the service to fully initialise and display data when initially run. You will see the below loading screen while it is initially loading. Please note, it can take a while (multiple hours) to display token and contract details as it needs to process the entire blockchain history. AWS \u00b6 The AWS Marketplace offer provides a pre-configured VM with Epirus already installed. It requires an active AWS subscription. You will need to provide details of the RPC endpoint for your Hyperledger Besu/Quorum/Ethereum node. Copy the RPC endpoint for your node, such as http://<your-service-url>:8545 (the default RPC port is 8545). This is the same URL you use to attach a console to your node - i.e. geth attach http://<your-service-url>:8545 (for more information, head here ). Once the virtual machine has been deployed, launch a terminal on the machine: ssh -i <keyfile> ubuntu@<machine name> Then copy the HTTPS access keys with node URL, such as http://<your-service-url> Once the virtual machine has been deployed, launch a terminal on the machine. Then run the following command to configure the node ( please note AWS requires authentication credentials to be configured ): $ sudo epirus setup Configuring Epirus instance Please enter a username: <enter username> New password: <enter password> Re-type new password: <re-enter password> Adding password for user <username> Please enter node URL: http://<your-service-url> Successfully connected to http://<your-service-url> Configuration written to /usr/local/src/epirus/epirus.conf You can then start the Epirus service: $ sudo systemctl start epirus.service You will be able to access the Explorer UI via http://vm-ip-address-or-hostname , providing the authentication credentials you specified when prompted. Please allow a few minutes for the service to fully initialise and display data when initially run. It will automatically start up on subsequent reboots.

Free \u00b6 A free, feature limited version of Epirus is available. This version is updated periodically, unlike the Azure and SaaS offerings which are constantly being updated with the latest features. To get started with the free version, you'll need Git installed and an Ethereum, Hyperledger Besu or Quorum node endpoint.
